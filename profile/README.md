# Brain-Computer Interfaces with Everyone ðŸ§ 

[Neural Interfaces](https://neuralinterfaces.com) maintains open-source tools for authoring brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) on web technologies, allowing developers to publish across multiple platforms. 

We believe that brain-computer interfaces should be accessible to everyone.

## Key Projects
- [Brains@Play](https://github.com/neuralinterfaces/brainsatplay): A multi-platform application for brain-controlled experiencesâ€”as well as an API for accessing neural data across platforms.
- [Commoners](https://github.com/neuralinterfaces/commoners): A domain-agnostic build tool for authoring multi-platform applications.
