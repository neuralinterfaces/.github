# Brain-Computer Interfaces for the Rest of Us 🧠
> **Neural interfaces** (noun) — Devices that interact with the nervous system. They are electronic devices placed on the outside or inside of the brain or nervous system to record or stimulate activity – or both. (Source: [The Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/ihuman-perspective/))


[Neural Interfaces](https://neuralinterfaces.com) helps you publish brain-responsive applications across multiple platforms using modern web technologies.

We believe that brain-computer interfaces should be accessible to everyone.

## Key Projects
- [Neurosys](https://github.com/neuralinterfaces/neurosys): A desktop application for system-level neurofeedback.
- [Commoners](https://github.com/neuralinterfaces/commoners): A domain-agnostic build tool for authoring multi-platform applications.
