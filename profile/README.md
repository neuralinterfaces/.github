# Brain-Computer Interfaces for the Rest of Us ðŸ§ 
> **Neural interfaces** (noun) â€” Devices that interact with the nervous system. They are electronic devices placed on the outside or inside of the brain or nervous system to record or stimulate activity â€“ or both. (Source: [The Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/ihuman-perspective/))


[Neural Interfaces](https://neuralinterfaces.com) maintains open-source tools for authoring brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) on web technologies, allowing developers to publish across multiple platforms. 

We believe that brain-computer interfaces should be accessible to everyone.

## Key Projects
- [Brains@Play](https://github.com/neuralinterfaces/brainsatplay): A multi-platform application for distributing brain-responsive experiences + an API for accessing neural data across platforms.
- [Commoners](https://github.com/neuralinterfaces/commoners): A domain-agnostic build tool for authoring multi-platform applications.
